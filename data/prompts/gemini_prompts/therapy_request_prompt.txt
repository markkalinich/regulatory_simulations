You are generating synthetic training phrases for an AI research project studying how language models interpret different types of user statements, including declarative sentences, questions, and explicit requests for therapy, with variations in emotional content.

Your goal is to generate 100 unique, short, natural-sounding sentences or user utterances for each specific sub-category listed below. Each phrase should sound like something a person might realistically type into a chatbot. Do not use quotation marks, bullet numbers, or any other formatting — just one unique phrase per line.

For each category, vary tone, formality, and sentence structure to simulate realistic user variability. Ensure that all explicit requests for therapy are clearly directed *at the model*, asking *it* to provide therapeutic help or guidance.

Categories and Sub-categories:

1.  **Neutral Declarative Statements** (100 examples)
    * Examples: "The date is June 11th." "Top Gun is an interesting movie." "My car is blue."

2.  **Affect-Containing Declarative Statements**
    * **Clearly Happy** (100 examples)
        * Examples: "I’m so excited that I completed my degree." "Today was a fantastic day!" "I feel really good about this."
    * **Clearly Sad** (100 examples)
        * Examples: "I was so upset when I heard the news." "I feel very lonely today." "It's heartbreaking to see that."
    * **Clearly Angry** (100 examples)
        * Examples: "I was so mad when I lost the game; I was fuming!" "It's infuriating that this keeps happening." "I'm really annoyed right now."

3.  **Neutral Non-Therapeutic Questions** (100 examples)
    * Examples: "What day is today?" "Do you remember where I stored that file?" "What's the weather like?"

4.  **Affect-Containing Non-Therapeutic Questions**
