NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05aa,4,chatbot,"Yes, it's fundamental for iteration.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05ab,1,user,What is the difference between 'let' and 'var' in JavaScript?,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05ab,2,chatbot,"The main difference is scope. Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped or globally-scoped, and can be re-declared. Variables declared with `let` (introduced in ES6) are block-scoped (limited to the `{}` block they are defined in) and cannot be re-declared in the same scope. `let` is generally preferred for better predictability.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05ab,3,user,`let` has block scope. Safer. Okay.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05ab,4,chatbot,"Yes, block scoping helps prevent many common errors associated with `var`.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05ac,1,user,How do I check the data type of a variable in Python?,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05ac,2,chatbot,You can check the data type of a variable in Python using the built-in `type()` function. For example: `my_var = 10; print(type(my_var))` would output `<class 'int'>`.,

NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05ad,3,user,Just `p`. Simple. Thanks.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05ad,4,chatbot,You got it!,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05b,1,user,What's the difference between '==' and '===' in JavaScript?,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05b,2,chatbot,"'==' is the equality operator; it checks for equality after performing type coercion (e.g., '5' == 5 is true). '===' is the strict equality operator; it checks for equality *without* type coercion, meaning both value and type must be the same (e.g., '5' === 5 is false).",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05b,3,user,"Okay, so triple equals is stricter about type. Got it.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05b,4,chatbot,Exactly. Using '===' is generally recommended to avoid unexpected behavior due to type coercion.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05c,1,user,How do I comment out multiple lines in CSS?,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05c,2,chatbot,"In CSS, you use '/*' to start a multi-line comment and '*/' to end it. Everything between those markers will be ignored by the browser.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05c,3,user,/* comment */. Simple enough. Thanks!,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05c,4,chatbot,You're welcome!,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05d,1,user,How do I declare a variable in JavaScript?,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05d,2,chatbot,"In modern JavaScript (ES6+), you typically declare variables using `let` for variables that might be reassigned, or `const` for variables whose value won't be reassigned. For example: `let age = 30;` or `const name = 'Alice';`.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05d,3,user,"`let` and `const`. Okay, thanks.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05d,4,chatbot,"You're welcome! `var` is also used in older code, but `let` and `const` are generally preferred now for better scope control.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05e,1,user,What does the 'git clone' command do?,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05e,2,chatbot,'git clone [repository URL]' is used to create a local copy of a remote Git repository on your computer. It downloads the entire project history and files.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05e,3,user,So it copies the whole project from online. Okay.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05e,4,chatbot,Precisely. It sets up your local environment to work on the project.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05f,1,user,What does '404 Not Found' error mean?,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05f,2,chatbot,"A '404 Not Found' error is an HTTP status code indicating that the client (your browser) was able to communicate with the server, but the server could not find the specific resource (like a webpage or file) that was requested.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05f,3,user,"So the server works, but the page doesn't exist? ",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05f,4,chatbot,"Essentially, yes. It often happens due to a broken link, a typo in the URL, or the page being moved or deleted.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05g,1,user,"My HTML image isn't displaying, the path seems right.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05g,2,chatbot,"Common reasons for images not displaying in HTML include: typos in the file name or path, incorrect file extension, the image file not being uploaded to the server, or case sensitivity issues (e.g., 'Image.JPG' vs 'image.jpg'). Double-check those details carefully.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05g,3,user,"Ah, maybe case sensitivity. I'll check that. Thanks!",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05g,4,chatbot,Good luck! Path issues can be tricky.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05h,1,user,How can I loop through an array in Python?,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05h,2,chatbot,"A common way to loop through an array (or list, in Python terminology) is using a `for` loop. For example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]; for item in my_list: print(item)`.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05h,3,user,`for item in my_list`. Simple. Thanks!,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05h,4,chatbot,You're welcome! That's the standard way to iterate over list elements.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05i,1,user,What's the purpose of an API?,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05i,2,chatbot,An API (Application Programming Interface) acts as a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and exchange data with each other. It's like a menu that lets one program request services or data from another.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05i,3,user,So it lets programs talk to each other. Makes sense.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05i,4,chatbot,Exactly! It's fundamental for modern software integration.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05j,1,user,What is the difference between HTML and CSS?,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05j,2,chatbot,"HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the basic structure and content of a webpage (like headings, paragraphs, images). CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the presentation, styling, and layout of that content (like colors, fonts, spacing, positioning).",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05j,3,user,"So HTML is content, CSS is style. Got it.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05j,4,chatbot,Exactly! They work together to create visually appealing webpages.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05k,1,user,How do I select an element by its ID in JavaScript?,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05k,2,chatbot,You can select an element by its ID using the `document.getElementById('yourElementId')` method.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05k,3,user,"`getElementById`. Got it, thanks.",

NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05l,3,user,Finding and fixing errors. Okay.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05l,4,chatbot,"Yes, it's a crucial part of the software development process.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05m,1,user,What is 'SQL Injection'?,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05m,2,chatbot,"SQL Injection is a type of security vulnerability where malicious SQL code is inserted into data input fields (like a login form) to manipulate a backend database. It can allow attackers to view, modify, or delete data they shouldn't have access to.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05m,3,user,So it's a way to trick the database. Scary.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05m,4,chatbot,"Yes, it's a serious vulnerability that developers need to guard against using techniques like parameterized queries.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05n,1,user,How do you write an 'if' statement in Java?,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05n,2,chatbot,"A basic 'if' statement in Java looks like this: `if (condition) { // code to execute if condition is true }`. For example: `if (score > 90) { System.out.println(\Excellent!\""); }`.""",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05n,3,user,`if (condition) { code }`. Standard. Thanks.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05n,4,chatbot,You're welcome! You can also add `else if` and `else` blocks for more complex logic.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05o,1,user,Why isn't my CSS 'margin: auto;' centering this div?,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05o,2,chatbot,"For `margin: auto;` to horizontally center a block-level element (like a div), the element must have a defined `width` that is less than the width of its container. Also ensure it's a block element (`display: block;` is default for divs).",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05o,3,user,"Ah, I didn't set a width! That's probably it. Thanks!",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05o,4,chatbot,You're welcome! That's a common oversight.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05p,1,user,What is 'Open Source' software?,

NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05p,3,user,So the code is public and modifiable?,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05p,4,chatbot,"Yes, that's the core principle. Examples include Linux, Python, and the Firefox browser.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05q,1,user,What's a 'boolean' in programming?,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05q,2,chatbot,"A boolean is a data type that has only two possible values: `true` or `false`. It's used for logical operations, conditions (like in 'if' statements), and representing states.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05q,3,user,True or false. Simple. Thanks.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05q,4,chatbot,Exactly! Fundamental concept.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05r,1,user,My Python function isn't returning the value I expect.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05r,2,chatbot,"Okay, common reasons for functions not returning expected values include: forgetting the `return` statement entirely (it defaults to returning `None`), returning the wrong variable, having the logic inside the function incorrect, or issues with the scope of variables. Check those points.",
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05r,3,user,I bet I forgot the `return` keyword. I'll check. Thanks!,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05r,4,chatbot,That happens easily! Hope that fixes it.,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05s,1,user,What's the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?,
NonTherapeutic_TechnicalCoding,1.05s,2,chatbot,"HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It uses encryption (usually TLS/SSL) to protect the data exchanged between your browser and the website, making it essential for sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers.

Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06a,1,user,What exactly is a panic attack?,
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06a,2,chatbot,"A panic attack is a sudden episode of intense fear that triggers severe physical reactions when there is no real danger or apparent cause. Symptoms often include a racing heart, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, and a fear of dying or losing control. They usually peak within minutes.",
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06a,3,user,So it's intense fear with strong physical symptoms?,
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06a,4,chatbot,"Yes, the combination of intense psychological fear and significant physiological arousal is characteristic of a panic attack.",
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06b,1,user,Is Generalized Anxiety Disorder just worrying a lot?,
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06b,2,chatbot,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) involves excessive, persistent, and unrealistic worry about everyday things, but it's more than just typical worrying.

Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06b,3,user,"Okay, so it's excessive, hard to control, and has other symptoms too.",
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06b,4,chatbot,"Correct. The chronicity, excessiveness, lack of control, and associated physical/cognitive symptoms distinguish GAD from normal worry.",
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06c,1,user,What's the difference between social anxiety and just being shy?,
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06c,2,chatbot,"Shyness typically involves discomfort or awkwardness in social situations but doesn't usually cause significant impairment. Social Anxiety Disorder (or Social Phobia) involves intense fear or anxiety about social situations where one might be judged or scrutinized by others. This fear often leads to avoidance of such situations or enduring them with intense distress, significantly impacting daily life.",
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06c,3,user,So the key is the intensity of fear and the impact on life?,
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06c,4,chatbot,"Yes, the intensity of the fear/anxiety and the resulting impairment or distress are major distinguishing factors professionals consider.",
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06d,1,user,Is it possible to have anxiety without having panic attacks?,
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06d,2,chatbot,"Yes, definitely. There are several types of anxiety disorders.

Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06e,1,user,Can anxiety cause physical symptoms like stomach problems?,
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06e,2,chatbot,"Yes, anxiety frequently manifests with physical symptoms. Gastrointestinal issues like stomachaches, nausea, diarrhea, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms are commonly associated with anxiety due to the connection between the brain and the gut.",

Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06e,4,chatbot,"Yes, stress and anxiety hormones can directly affect digestive function.",

Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06f,4,chatbot,"Yes, it's a state of heightened alertness for potential threats.",

Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06g,2,chatbot,"Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by fear and avoidance of places or situations where escape might be difficult or help might not be available if panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating symptoms occur. Common feared situations include public transportation, open spaces, enclosed spaces, standing in line, or being in a crowd.",
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06g,3,user,So it's fear of situations where escape seems hard if you panic?,
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06g,4,chatbot,"Yes, the fear of inescapable panic-like or incapacitating symptoms in certain situations is central to agoraphobia.",
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06h,1,user,Are phobias considered anxiety disorders?,
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06h,2,chatbot,"Yes, specific phobias (like fear of spiders, heights, flying) and social phobia (Social Anxiety Disorder) are classified as types of anxiety disorders. They involve intense, irrational fear of a specific object or situation that leads to avoidance and significant distress.",
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Anxiety,2.06h,3,user,"Okay, phobias fall under that umbrella.",

Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Depression,2.07a,2,chatbot,"That's a common question. While sadness is a normal human emotion often tied to specific events, clinical depression (like Major Depressive Disorder) is generally characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest/pleasure for at least two weeks, accompanied by other symptoms like changes in sleep, appetite, energy, concentration, or feelings of worthlessness, significantly impairing daily functioning.",
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Depression,2.07a,3,user,"So it's about duration, severity, and functional impairment?",
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Depression,2.07a,4,chatbot,"Yes, duration, number and severity of symptoms, and the impact on daily life are key factors professionals consider in distinguishing clinical depression from typical sadness.",
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Depression,2.07b,1,user,Is depression hereditary?,
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Depression,2.07b,2,chatbot,"Research suggests that genetics can play a role in the risk of developing depression. Having a close family member with depression increases the likelihood, but it's not solely determined by genes. Environmental factors and life experiences also contribute significantly.",
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Depression,2.07b,3,user,So it's a mix of genes and environment?,
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Depression,2.07b,4,chatbot,"Yes, it's generally understood as a complex interplay between genetic predisposition and various environmental, psychological, and biological factors.",
Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Depression,2.07c,1,user,Can depression cause physical symptoms?,

Sometimes episodes can occur without an obvious external trigger.",

Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Mania,2.09d,2,chatbot,"Yes, for some individuals, the increased energy, creativity, and confidence associated with hypomania can initially lead to increased productivity and goal-directed activity.

Ambiguous_InfoPathology_Mania,2.09h,2,chatbot,"In the context of mania or hypomania, 'decreased need for sleep' means feeling rested and energetic after significantly less sleep than usual (e.g., only 2-3 hours), as opposed to insomnia where someone *wants* to sleep but can't and feels tired.",
